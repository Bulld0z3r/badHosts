List of Adware/Malware/Telemetry domains

Are you tired of all this nonsense as I am?
Then feel free to do whatever with this list!

you can add this list to your Pi-hole, or just replace or add it to your local hosts file.
it will not block 100% of all the Adware/Malware/Telemetry but thats a good start.

I will try to update it as often as I can to keep the bad players away ;)
